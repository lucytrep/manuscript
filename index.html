			<h2>WHAT IS CODE?</h2>
			<p>June 11, 2015</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>

			<p>As a graphic and digital designer, I can appreciate the parallel between code and design. Both are incredibly meticulous, and each step contributes to the final product. With coding, you are problem-solving through each letter, word, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, etc., and creating an explicit list of instructions carried out by logic, which is then turned into software (Ford, 2015). In my experience, design works similarly. The wrong choice of imagery, colour, or font can jar a user just as much as seeing raw HTML code on a website. As a designer, I am curious to see how much I can relate and apply my previous knowledge, perfectionism, and personal differences to this subject. Art directors questioning my designs and developers explaining issues with my Figma frames have shown me that design and code can be inextricably linked. 
			
			Reading What Is Code? made me reflect on why it’s taken me so long to finally learn and explore the world of interaction design. I have wanted to do this for years, but why was I so hesitant before? Ford brings up things in his discussion that stood out to me, and why internal or external factors have affected me thus far.
			
			It is important to realize that coding is similar to learning a new world language. However, unlike spoken language taught through interaction, coding is strictly on screen and with the computer. Mistakes offer no forgiveness, and the code either works or it does not, with little to no explanation. This makes it daunting, frustrating, and so much more… especially for us beginners.
			
			Ford’s discussion highlights how coding is largely a male-dominated environment that has intimidated many women from pursuing it. But we see historically, women have been among the true pioneers! From my previous experience as a graphic designer, I’ve seen how gender diversity and different perspectives add value and strengthen a final product. When design and code backgrounds work together and intertwine, something beautiful can be created. I am optimistic that more women and diverse groups will become involved as technology expands. Like design, code has so much more creative potential, and we must put the stereotypes aside. This makes me question why Ford describes it as “complex and boring” (Ford, 2015). I think coding holds a lot of possibilities for playfulness and innovation, particularly when paired with curiosity and design thinking.
			
			Coding can be intimidating, but it calls for a broader audience. As Ford infers, the issue lies in the external environment, so it will be up to those within it to push for a more inclusive and welcoming community. Diversity and participation from all backgrounds can only heighten coding's impact. I am encouraged and excited that our class is predominantly female from all over the world. This gives me so much hope for women in STEM and that the industry is shifting. Women are some of the most revolutionary parts of code’s timeline, including Ada Lovelace and Grace Murray (Ford, 2015). Diverse voices spark new and innovative ideas that break down what we currently know. Despite the challenges I personally face as a neurodivergent learner, I see a window of opportunity, and I’m ready to participate and make an impact.</p>
